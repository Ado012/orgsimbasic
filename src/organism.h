	/// reading. First it reads a number of parameters, a topology with
	/// its reactions and compartmentchanges. Then it reads all species
	/// (molecules) with their reactions, followed by reading additional
	/// reactions. Finally it possibly reads a neighborhood.
	///
	/// Here follows a detailed discussion on the parameters in the model,
	/// divided into reasonable sub-parts.
	///
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	/// ModelName @f$ N_t N_s N_r N_n @f$ <br>
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	///
	/// The first line in the model file reads an odentity string for the model
	/// (which is only for the user), and then reads the number of different
	/// structures to be presented in the model file.
	///
	/// <ul> 
	/// 
	/// <li> @b @f$ N_t @f$ - number of topologies, which handles the positional
	/// and size variables, including cell divisions and removal. In the present
	/// version this can be either zero or one.
	///
	/// <li> @b @f$ N_s @f$ - number of molecular species included in the model.
	///
	/// <li> @b @f$ N_r @f$ - number of reaction in the model. Note that reactions
	/// also can be defined within the definition of the topology and molecular
	/// species. 
	///
	/// <li> @b @f$ N_n @f$ - number of neighborhood rules defined. Only zero or
	/// one is available at present.
	///
	/// </ul>
	///
	/// Then it is time to read the topology:
	///
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	/// TopologyName @f$ N_v^t N_r^t N_c^t @f$ <br>
	/// reaction1 @f$ N_p^{r1} N_{il}^{r1} N_{i1}^{r1} @f$ ... <br>
	/// @f$ p_1^{r1} p_2^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{11}^{r1} i_{12}^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{21}^{r1} i_{22}^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// ... <br>

	/// @f$ p_1^{r2} p_2^{r2} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{11}^{r2} i_{12}^{r2} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{21}^{r2} i_{22}^{r2} ... @f$ <br>
	/// ... <br>
	/// compartmentChange1 ... <br>
	/// ... <br>
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	///
	/// The fist line reads a user-defined name of the topology followed by the
	/// number of variables (@f$ N_v^t @f$) used for describing the topology of
	/// each compartment. This number is the dimension plus one for spherical
	/// cells, two times the dimension plus one for bacterial cells, etc. Then
	/// the number of reactions acting on the topology variables, @f$ N_r^t @f$
	/// and the number of compartment changes defined, @f$ N_c^t @f$, are
	/// read. The format of the reactions can be found below. The compartment
	/// changes defines rules for cell division, cell removal etc. ADD
	/// DESCRIPTION ON COMPARTMENT CHANGE FORMAT HERE. Available compartment
	/// changes are the classes inheriting BaseCompartmentChange.
	///
	/// Each species (@f$ N_s @f$) is read as:
	///
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	/// SpeciesName @f$ i_s N_r^t @f$ <br>
	/// reaction1 @f$ N_p^{r1} N_{il}^{r1} N_{i1}^{r1} @f$ ... <br>
	/// @f$ p_1^{r1} p_2^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{11}^{r1} i_{12}^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{21}^{r1} i_{22}^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// ... <br>
	/// reaction2 @f$ N_p^{r2} N_{il}^{r2} N_{i1}^{r2} @f$ ... <br>
	/// @f$ p_1^{r2} p_2^{r2} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{11}^{r2} i_{12}^{r2} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{21}^{r2} i_{22}^{r2} ... @f$ <br>
	/// ... <br>
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	///
	/// The first line reads a user defined name for the species followed by the
	/// variable index of this molecule, and the number of reactions defined
	/// here for this molecule. The index should be an increasing number in the
	/// list of species starting at the number of topology variables (see
	/// above), since the topology uses the indises @f$ [0...N_v^t-1] @f$. Then
	/// each reaction is defined as described below.
	///
	/// @f$ N_r @f$ reactions are read as:
	///
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	/// reaction1 @f$ N_p^{r1} N_{il}^{r1} N_{i1}^{r1} @f$ ... <br>
	/// @f$ p_1^{r1} p_2^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{11}^{r1} i_{12}^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// @f$ i_{21}^{r1} i_{22}^{r1} ... @f$ <br>
	/// ... <br>
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	///
	/// Possible reactions can be found among the classes inheriting
	/// BaseReaction.
	///
	/// Finally, if @f$ N_n=1 @f$ a rule for defining a neighborhood is read:
	///
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
	/// neighborhoodName ... <br>
	/// ... <br>
	/// ----------------------------------------<br>
